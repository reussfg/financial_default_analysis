# Financial Default Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a financial dataset, focused on predicting whether a bank customer will default on their credit payment or not. The analysis is presented in the form of a Jupyter notebook (default_bank.ipynb), which includes explanations of the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

# Data
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and contains information about bank customers' demographics, credit history, and financial behavior. The dataset includes 30,000 instances, with 23 features, and a binary target variable indicating whether the customer defaulted on their credit payment or not.

# Analysis
The analysis presented in the default_bank.ipynb notebook follows a typical data science workflow, including the following steps:

# Data exploration: the notebook starts with an exploratory data analysis, aimed at understanding the distribution of the features, the relationships between them, and the imbalance of the target variable.

# Data preprocessing: the notebook then proceeds with a data preprocessing step, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features.

# Data processing: the notebook process the data to analyze for most common default groups and characteristics.

Model evaluation: finally, the notebook evaluates the performance of the models using different metrics.

Usage
To use the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine, and open the default_bank.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any other compatible environment. The notebook requires several Python packages, including numpy, pandas, shapiro. These packages can be installed using pip or any other package manager.
